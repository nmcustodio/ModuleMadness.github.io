			    <h3>About the Game:</h3>
     		    <p>"Module Madness" is a game that enhances your typing speed, accuracy, and skills in a much more fun and engaging way. As the developers of this game are students from a prestigious high school, the developers 
			    decided that the game’s main character focuses on a student traveling around a school. The game’s base is about a student travelling, but there are certain obstacles they must take care of, which are the teachers
			    These teachers attack the student-player with words written on books/scrolls. The only way to get past every obstacle provided by them is to type the words given onto your keyboards. The fascinating part of this game 
			    is that the game’s speed is consistent the entire game, since the game focuses on the development of the player’s skills to maintain their performance for a certain time frame without betraying their speed and accuracy.</p>
